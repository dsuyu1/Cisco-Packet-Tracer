In this lab, I connect common network devices to simulate a simple home LAN. Since we haven't gone over the different types of wiring yet, the type of connections wasn't taken into account for this lab. However, as we can see, the iPad and Android phones are connected wirelessly while we have a switch that physically connects to two personal computers, a server, and a printer. The cable modem connects to our router to provide us internet access from our ISP, represented by the cloud.
