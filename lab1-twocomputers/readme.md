# Lab #1: Two Computers
## Introduction
This is the first lab in my Cisco Packet Tracker (CPT) series. In this lab, I connected two PCs together. 

## 1: Making a Connection
Making a connection between two devices is simple. You select the lightning icon. Click on the devices to which you want to connect.

## 2. Sending data
Turning at least one of the computers off terminates the connection. Notice how the once-green triangles are now red. 

We can start transmitting data by selecting the Simple PDU icon and drag and drop it on top of each computer. We can then select the Simulation button to run the connection! We can view the data going back and forth between computers. 

 ## 3. Conclusion
And that's a wrap! This lab was the first and hence the simplest that I'll be doing. Here is the final product:
