# ciscopackettracer
## Objective

Cisco Packet Tracer (CPT) is a powerful network simulation tool where I'll practice networking, IoT, and cybersecurity skills in a virtual lab. The objective is to visualize how a network works, practice rack, stack, and cabling skills, plus integrate IoT devices. In this project, I'll do a series of labs, starting from the basics and working my way up to more complex topologies. <br>

Network topologies define the physical (wires, media, cables) and logical (the movement of data) components of a network. In the real world, they give us a bird's eye view of the networks we work with. As a future cybersecurity and IT
professional, I aim to gain a deeper and fundamental understanding of networks and how they function using CPT.

## Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding of networking concepts and practical applications.
- Proficiency in analyzing network traffic.
- Enhanced knowledge of physical network connections.
- Ability to map out real-world networks.
