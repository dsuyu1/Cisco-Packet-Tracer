In this lab, I make a hybrid topology using a Star topology (the most popular kind of network structure) and a partial Mesh topology. Since our servers only have two NICs, they aren't able to connect to each other to make it a full Mesh topology. Because Switch 2 connects to Switch 1 and 3, we have a Hybrid topology.
