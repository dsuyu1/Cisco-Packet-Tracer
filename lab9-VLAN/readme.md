In this section, I'll be setting up two VLANs for two different fictional departments: the HR department and the Sales department. This can be done via the switch settings. Under "VLAN Database," we can create new VLAN numbers and names. 

- HR is 10
- Sales is 20

Then, we can navigate to the individual ports on the switch and configure them so that they belong to their respective VLANs.

- Ports 1 and 2 belong to the Sales VLAN
- Ports 3 and 4 belong to the HR VLAN
