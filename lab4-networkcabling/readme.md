In this lab, I use differnet kinds of physical network cabling to connect our devices. Between similar devices we use cross-over cables, and for dissimilar devices, I used straight-through cabling. Between our cable modem and ISP I used coaxial, and between a DSL modem and DSL ISP, I used phone line cabling.
