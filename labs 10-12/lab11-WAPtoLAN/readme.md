First, I'll add a home router device and set it to wireless AP mode. For simplicity's sake, we'll only have the WAP be on the 2.4 GHz band. We'll disable both 5 GHz options.

Going into "Wireless Security," we can also enable WPA2 Personal (not Enterprise since we're not working with a large-scale environment).

Let's add a laptop with a NIC that will connect wirelessly to our newly configured WAP.

In summary, we took a SOHO device, put it into WAP mode, and changed some of the settings (2.4 GHz, SSID, WPA2 Personal). We then set up a laptop and configured it so that it utilizes that SSID.
